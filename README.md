Simple Stock Simulator
======================

Description
-----------
This is a quick and dirty stock simulator.  It was written by request but I had a lot of fun writing it.

Discussion
----------
This is my [Go](http://golang.org/) version.  Considering this is some of the first Go code I've written, please don't
expect anything clever nor revolutionary.  I've used a number of conventions and, in some cases, code from the
[Syncthing](http://syncthing.net/) project.  As required by Syncthing's license, I've made sure any files using a
substantial amount of their code has their copyright notice included in the header of the file.

Limitations
-----------
I'm not entirely sure what limitations I'll run into with this version yet.  I'm sure it won't be as easy as the Flask
version turned out to be.  I think that is largely due to the relative maturity of Python's library ecosystem in general,
and Flask's libraries specifically when compared to Go, which is still relatively new.  That being said, subtantial projects
have been implemented in Go, so any perceived limitations are most likely the result of my relative ignorance of Go's
capabilities and libraries.

TODO
----

0. Learn Go.
1. Write some code.
